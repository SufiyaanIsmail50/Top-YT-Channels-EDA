Download the zip file and extract it. I saved my jypyter notebook project as html so click on that one and you will see the whole project.
This was saved in html format because if I saved it as .ipynb, my plotly.express visualizations would not show.
The .csv file is the data I found on kaggle, this was the dataset I used to do my project :)
